# delaunay-bowyer-watson
Straightforward and somewhat dirty implementation of the Delaunay Triangulation

This program was written in another computer and transcribed manually.

Therefore typo errors might exist...

## How to use
1. Run the triangulation.py file ```python ./triangulation.py```
2. Click anywhere on the screen to create points
3. If three or more points are recorded, triangulation will automatically happen and the resulting mesh will be rendered
* Press Q to remove the last point
* Press R to clear all points
